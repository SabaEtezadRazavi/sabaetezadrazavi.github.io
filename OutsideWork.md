<h1 align="center"> <p style="color:#ff7f50;"> Woah! What a wonderful world! </p> </h1>


I explore the sky while working, and in my spare time, I search for what is left undiscovered for me from feelings and experiences on the Earth!

I love to explore new places and randomly walk or bike around cities to find antique bookstores, random treasures in old forgotten stores, or a beautiful silent spot to sit and read and watch the sunset. 


I sometimes write short reviews in English and Persian on the books I read, which you can find on my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/151073804-saba-etezad-razavi).
